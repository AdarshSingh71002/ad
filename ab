Daily Schedule for Adarsh
Day 1: Develop Custom Prompt for Langfuse Evaluation (8 hours)
Create a custom prompt template for LLM-as-a-Judge in Langfuse, targeting accuracy, coherence, and relevance.
Test the prompt with a sample dataset for one use case (e.g., summarization) across two LLMs (e.g., GPT-based, custom model).
Refine prompt based on initial results.
Deliverable: Initial custom prompt and test results.

Day 2: Expand Prompt Evaluation Across Use Cases and Models (8 hours)
Adapt the prompt for additional use cases: question answering and code generation.
Test the prompt across multiple LLMs (e.g., Llama-based, custom model) using datasets for each use case.
Analyze Langfuse traces and scores to identify the best prompt.
Deliverable: Optimized prompt and multi-use-case test results.

Day 3: Explore Agent QA Tools and Draft Web/API Testing Approaches (8 hours)
Explore Playwright MCP for web testing and API testing tools (e.g., fetch or axios) for Agent QA.
Draft web testing approach: LLM generates Playwright scripts for browser interactions (e.g., form validation).
Draft API testing approach: LLM generates API test cases from natural language inputs.
Create flow diagrams for web and API testing workflows.
Deliverable: Draft web and API testing sections with flow diagrams.

Day 4: Draft Agent Testing and Prompt Evaluation Approaches (8 hours)
Draft agent testing approach: evaluate LLM agent task completion and tool usage (e.g., Playwright MCP).
Draft prompt evaluation approach: integrate Langfuse evaluation into Agent QA for assessing test outputs.
Create flow diagrams for agent testing and prompt evaluation workflows.
Test Agent QA tools with a sample scenario to validate approaches.
Deliverable: Draft agent testing and prompt evaluation sections with flow diagrams.

Day 5: Finalize Agent QA Solution Document and Demo (8 hours)
Compile the Agent QA solution document, integrating all testing approaches and flow diagrams.
Document the best Langfuse prompt and evaluation results.
Prepare a demo showcasing the prompt evaluation and Agent QA workflows.
Review and refine documentation for clarity.
Deliverable: Final Agent QA solution document, prompt evaluation summary, and demo.
